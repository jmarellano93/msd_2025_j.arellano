1) What is the GC-content value of the Human Gene CD28?

According to my GC-content analysis of the NG_029618.1 RefSeqGene retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/940, 
the GC-content is equal to 39.936172%.

2) What is a fasta file? 

A FASTA file is a simple text-based format used to represent DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.
It has:
A) A header line starting with > that contains the sequence name or identifier.
B) One or more lines containing the actual sequence (A, T, C, G, etc.).
For example:
>CD28_Human
ATGGCTAGCTAGCTACGATCGATCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGC
TGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGAC

3) What happens if there are multiple sequences in the fasta file? 

My software can process fasta files with multiple sequences and analyze each of them. 

4) What happens if the fasta file is invalid? 

If the header line doesn't start with >, it raises a ValueError.
If the sequence contains invalid characters (not A, T, C, G, or N), it raises a ValueError.
The user is then prompted to re-enter the sequence or correct the file.

5) What happens if there are upper case and lower case letters in the sequence? 

The FASTA format is not case-sensitive, so my code converts all sequence lines to uppercase. 

6) Where to download a sequence for a human gene?  

You can download human gene sequences, including CD28, from the following trusted bioinformatics databases:

NCBI Gene:
CD28 at NCBI

Ensembl:
CD28 at Ensembl

UCSC Genome Browser:
Search for CD28, select the transcript, then export as FASTA.
